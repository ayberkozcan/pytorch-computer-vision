# PyTorch Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains various computer vision projects implemented using PyTorch. Each project is organized as a separate .ipynb (Google Colab) notebook.

## Projects
### 1. Handwritten Digits Classification
Classifies handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

File: Handwritten Digits Classification.ipynb
* A custom model was created
* Trained on the MNIST dataset
* Evaluation was performed using accuracy and loss metrics, as well as the confusion matrix
* Makes predictions on a custom image (digit.jpg) uploaded to the notebook

### 2. CIFAR-10 Image Classification
Classifies images into 10 categories (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck) using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

* A custom model was created
* Implemented transfer learning using the EfficientNetB0 model, compared with a custom model
* Trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset
* Evaluation was performed using accuracy and loss metrics, as well as the confusion matrix
* Makes predictions on custom images (horse.jpg) uploaded to the notebook
