# PyTorch Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains various computer vision projects implemented using PyTorch. Each project is organized as a separate .ipynb (Google Colab) notebook.

## Projects
### 1. Handwritten Digits Classification
* Classifies handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
* File: Handwritten Digits Classification.ipynb
* Neural network built with PyTorch
* Trained on the MNIST dataset
* Makes predictions on a custom image (digit.jpg) uploaded to the notebook
